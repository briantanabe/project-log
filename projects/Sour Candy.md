# Project 1: Homemade Sour Candy
**This is an engineering log**, so you might ask why I'm documenting the process of making sour candy. Simply put, *[Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  is hard, and documentation is harder*. My hope is that starting with easier projects will let me  focus on learning how to **phrase and describe my progress real time**. So off to the races!

## Overview
**I  LOVE sour patch kids**, and after hitting [Google](http://www.grouprecipes.com/137183/homemade-sour-patch-kids.html), it looked pretty straightforward. I'm sure it will be harder than it looks (*[ahem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppi0khS0s_8)*), so I decided to just give it a try!
