# Project 1: Homemade Sour Candy


## Overview
**This is an engineering log**, so why am I documenting the process of making sour candy? Simply put, [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  is hard, and documentation is harder. My hope is that starting with easier projects will let me  focus on learning how to *phrase and describe my progress real time.*

**I  love sour patch kids**, and after hitting [Google](http://www.grouprecipes.com/137183/homemade-sour-patch-kids.html), it looked pretty straightforward. I'm sure it will be harder than it looks (*[ahem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppi0khS0s_8)*), so I decided to give it a shot and learn how to fail.

## Goals
The goals here are pretty straightforward:
1. Make some candy
2. Learn Markdown
3. **Learn about making sour candy**

I want to spend this first project getting a sense of the actual process and obtaining ~~an intuition~~ data about the ratio of ingredients. Because I couldn't find Tartaric Acid at Whole Foods, the only ingredients I will be investigating this time around are **gelatin**, **citric acid**, **water**, and **sugar**. I also bought **pectin** (*after remembering the time I made Jello Shots for my vegetarian friends*), though I suspect like many vegan substitutes, it may be harder to get right. 


## Google Facts

**Gelatin:**
Gelatin is commercially produced by first soaked pig skin in acid to release collagen [(Fine Cooking)](https://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-gelatin). The collagen is then heated to 160-180º F, at which point it melts into gelatin. Gelatin is a long, hydroscopic protein that does not readily form bonds with itself. While it does loosen at higher temperatures and form a sticky network, it will not form bonds and coagulate (unlike an egg). [(Science of Cooking)](https://www.scienceofcooking.com/meat/slow_cooking1.htm#:~:text=160%C2%B0F%2F70%C2%B0,to%20gelatin%20at%20160%2F70.)

**Pectin:**
*Note: Fine cooking has amazing food chemistry primers*
Pectin is a long chain of polysaccharides (a carbohydrate), used to stick the cell walls of plants together. There are two kinds of commercial pectin, high and low methoxyl, or HM and LM. LM pectin sets with the addition of calcium, and HM pectin is far more common (though not always specified).

From what I can tell with my [Wikipedia chemistry degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoxy_group) and more [Fine Cooking](https://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-pectin), methoxyl is a negative molecule that repels itself and is attracted to water. In the presence of acid (positive hydrogen ions), however, the negative charges will be somewhat neutralized. By heating pectin and acid, the pectin chains will loosen and form a loose matrix. Sugar will additionally attract the water molecules, competing with the pectin for water and tightening the chains. Slowly removing the water then firms the network into a sugar-acid-pectin gel, though the required ratios are reportedly very finicky. **This means fast set pectin has higher methylation levels (more methoxyl)** [(Cyber Colloids)](http://www.cybercolloids.net/information/technical-articles/introduction-pectin-properties).

*Todo: Find out pH at which pectin sets*

**Citric Acid:**
Though originally derived from lemons, Citric acid is largely manufactured and sold in powdered form. Citric acid is apparently one of the stronger edible acids, and **the pH of a 1 mM solution of citric acid will be about 3.2.**

**Claire Saffitz:**
If you aren't familiar with [Claire Saffitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pAOuR8s03Q), she's gained notoriety for recreating popular foods and talking through her decision making in the process. She did a [video on Sour Patch kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppi0khS0s_8), and made the following 

## Discussion
**Binding**
Unsurprisingly there is more online praise for animal based gelatin, though it appears it's largely used for sauces and desserts. I actually suspect pectin may produce a better texture under the right conditions as it requires a low pH to set; however, I worry that getting the sugar/acid/pectin ratio right may complicate evaluating pectin vs gelatin.

**Taste**
There were a lot of tips to navigate the pH of various added fruits when using pectin, so I suspect various artificial flavorings may have a similar problem.
