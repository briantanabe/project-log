# Project 1: Homemade Sour Candy


## Overview
**This is an engineering log**, so why am I documenting the process of making sour candy? Simply put, [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  is hard, and documentation is harder. My hope is that starting with easier projects will let me  focus on learning how to *phrase and describe my progress real time.*

**I  love sour patch kids**, and after hitting [Google](http://www.grouprecipes.com/137183/homemade-sour-patch-kids.html), it looked pretty straightforward. I'm sure it will be harder than it looks (*[ahem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppi0khS0s_8)*), so I decided to give it a shot and learn how to fail.

## Goals
The goals here are pretty straightforward:
1. Make some candy
2. Learn Markdown
3. **Learn about making sour candy**

I want to spend this first project getting a sense of the actual process and obtaining ~~an intuition~~ data about the ratio of ingredients. Because I couldn't find Tartaric Acid at Whole Foods, the only ingredients I will be investigating this time around are **gelatin**, **citric acid**, **water**, and **sugar**. I also bought **pectin** (*after remembering the time I made Jello Shots for my vegetarian friends*), though I suspect like many vegan substitutes, it may be harder to get right. 

### Trial 1

**Research on Gelatin:**
Gelatin is commercially produced by first soaked pig skin in acid to release collagen [(Fine Cooking)](https://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-gelatin). The collagen is then heated to 160-180ยบ F, at which point it melts into gelatin. Gelatin is a long, hydroscopic protein that does not readily form bonds with itself. While it does loosen at higher temperatures and form a sticky network, it will not form bonds and coagulate (unlike an egg). [(Science of Cooking)](https://www.scienceofcooking.com/meat/slow_cooking1.htm#:~:text=160%C2%B0F%2F70%C2%B0,to%20gelatin%20at%20160%2F70.)

**Research on Pectin:** *Note: Fine cooking has amazing food chemistry primers*
Pectin is a long chain of polysaccharides (a carbohydrate), used to stick the cell walls of plants together. There are two kinds of commercial pectin, high and low methoxyl, or HM and LM. LM pectin sets with calcium, though HM pectin is far more common (though not always specified).

From what I can tell with my [Wikipedia chemistry degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoxy_group) and more [Fine Cooking](https://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-pectin), methoxyl is a negative molecule that repels itself and is attracted to water. In the presence of acid (positive hydrogen ions), however, the negative charges will be somewhat neutralized. By heating pectin and acid, the pectin chains will loosen and form a loose matrix. Sugar will additionally attract the water molecules, competing with the pectin for water and tightening the chains. Slowly removing the water then firms the network into a sugar-acid-pectin gel, though the required ratios are reportedly very finicky. This all checks out with the idea of fast set or slow set
