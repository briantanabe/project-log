# Project 1: Homemade Sour Candy


## Overview
**This is an engineering log**, so why am I documenting the process of making sour candy? Simply put, [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  is hard, and documentation is harder. My hope is that starting with easier projects will let me  focus on learning how to *phrase and describe my progress real time.*

**I  love sour patch kids**, and after hitting [Google](http://www.grouprecipes.com/137183/homemade-sour-patch-kids.html), it looked pretty straightforward. I'm sure it will be harder than it looks (*[ahem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppi0khS0s_8)*), so I decided to give it a shot and learn how to fail.

## Goals
The goals here are pretty straightforward:
1. Make some candy
2. Learn Markdown
3. **Learn about making sour candy**

I want to spend this first project getting a sense of the actual process and obtaining ~~an intuition~~ data about the ratio of ingredients. Because I couldn't find Tartaric Acid at Whole Foods, the only ingredients I will be investigating this time around are **gelatin**, **citric acid**, **water**, and **sugar**. I also bought **pectin** (*after remembering the time I made Jello Shots for my vegetarian friends*), though I suspect like many vegan substitutes, it may be harder to get right. 

### Trial 1

**Research on Gelatin:**
Gelatin is commercially produced by first soaked pig skin in acid to release collagen [(Fine Cooking)](https://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-gelatin). The collagen is then heated to 160-180ยบ F, at which point it melts into gelatin. Gelatin is a long, hydroscopic protein that does not readily form bonds with itself. While it does loosen at higher temperatures and form a sticky network, it will not form bonds and coagulate (unlike an egg). [(Science of Cooking)](https://www.scienceofcooking.com/meat/slow_cooking1.htm#:~:text=160%C2%B0F%2F70%C2%B0,to%20gelatin%20at%20160%2F70.)

**Research on Pectin:** *Note: Fine cooking has amazing food chemistry primers*
Pectin is a long chain of polysaccharides (a carbohydrate), used to stick cells together. There are two kinds of commercial pectin, high and low methoxyl, or HM and LM.
