# Project 1: Homemade Sour Candy
**This is an engineering log**, so you might ask why I'm documenting the process of making sour candy. Simply put, [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  is hard, and documentation is harder. My hope is that starting with easier projects will let me  focus on learning how to **phrase and describe my progress real time**. So off to the races!

## Overview
*Started on Tuesday, April 13 at 8:30PM*

**I  LOVE sour patch kids**, and after hitting [Google](http://www.grouprecipes.com/137183/homemade-sour-patch-kids.html), it looked pretty straightforward. I'm sure it will be harder than it looks (*[ahem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppi0khS0s_8)*), so I decided to just give it a try!

## Goals
The goals here are pretty straightforward:
1. Make some candy
2. Learn Markdown
3. **Learn about making sour candy**

I want to spend this first project getting a sense of what the actual process of making Sour candy looks like, as well as ~~an intuition~~ data about the ratio of ingredients. Because I couldn't find Tartaric Acid at Whole Foods, the only ingredients I will be investigating this time around are **gelatin**, **citric acid**, **water**, and **sugar**. I also bought **pectin** (*after remembering the time I made Jello Shots for my vegetarian friends*), though I suspect like many vegan substitutes, it may be harder to get right. 

### Trial 1

**Research on Gelatin:**
Gelatin is commercially produced by first soaked pig skin in acid to release collagen [(Fine Cooking)](https://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-gelatin). Collagen is then heated to 160-180ยบ F, at which point it melts into gelatin [(Science of Cooking)](https://www.scienceofcooking.com/meat/slow_cooking1.htm#:~:text=160%C2%B0F%2F70%C2%B0,to%20gelatin%20at%20160%2F70.).  This makes it a very weird protein, as
