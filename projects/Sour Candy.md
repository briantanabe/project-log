# Project 1: Homemade Sour Candy


## Overview
**This is an engineering log**, so why am I documenting the process of making sour candy? Simply put, [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  is hard, and documentation is harder. My hope is that starting with easier projects will let me  focus on learning how to *phrase and describe my progress real time.*

**I  love sour patch kids**, and after hitting [Google](http://www.grouprecipes.com/137183/homemade-sour-patch-kids.html), it looked pretty straightforward. I'm sure it will be harder than it looks (*[ahem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppi0khS0s_8)*), so I decided to give it a shot and learn how to fail.

## Goals
The goals here are pretty straightforward:
1. Make some candy
2. Learn Markdown
3. **Learn about making sour candy**

I want to spend this first project getting a sense of the actual process and obtaining ~~an intuition~~ data about the ratio of ingredients. Because I couldn't find Tartaric Acid at Whole Foods, the only ingredients I will be investigating this time around are **gelatin**, **citric acid**, **water**, and **sugar**. I also bought **pectin** (*after remembering the time I made Jello Shots for my vegetarian friends*), though I suspect like many vegan substitutes, it may be harder to get right. 


## The Google Facts

**Gelatin:**
Gelatin is commercially produced by first soaked pig skin in acid to release collagen [(Fine Cooking)](https://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-gelatin). The collagen is then heated to 160-180º F, at which point it melts into gelatin. Gelatin is a long, hydroscopic protein that does not readily form bonds with itself. While it does loosen at higher temperatures and form a sticky network that sets when cooled, it will not form bonds and coagulate (unlike an egg). [(Science of Cooking)](https://www.scienceofcooking.com/meat/slow_cooking1.htm#:~:text=160%C2%B0F%2F70%C2%B0,to%20gelatin%20at%20160%2F70.)

**Pectin:**
*Note: Fine cooking has amazing food chemistry primers*
Pectin is a long chain of polysaccharides (a carbohydrate), used to stick the cell walls of plants together. There are two kinds of commercial pectin, high and low methoxyl, or HM and LM. LM pectin sets with the addition of calcium, and HM pectin is far more common (though not always specified).

From what I can tell with my [Wikipedia chemistry degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoxy_group) and more [Fine Cooking](https://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-pectin), methoxyl is a negative molecule that repels itself and is attracted to water. In the presence of acid (positive hydrogen ions), however, the negative charges will be somewhat neutralized. By heating pectin and acid, the pectin chains will loosen and form a loose matrix. Sugar will additionally attract the water molecules, competing with the pectin for water and tightening the chains. Slowly removing the water then firms the network into a sugar-acid-pectin gel, though the required ratios are reportedly very finicky. **This means fast set pectin has higher methylation levels (more methoxyl)** [(Cyber Colloids)](http://www.cybercolloids.net/information/technical-articles/introduction-pectin-properties).

*Todo: Find out pH at which pectin sets*

**Citric Acid:**
Though originally derived from lemons, Citric acid is largely manufactured and sold in powdered form. Citric acid is apparently one of the stronger edible acids, and **the pH of a 1 mM solution of citric acid will be about 3.2.**

**Claire Saffitz:**
If you aren't familiar with Bon Appetit's [Claire Saffitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pAOuR8s03Q), she's gained notoriety for recreating popular foods and talking through her decision making in the process. I trust her process a little more given that I can see results, and she did a [video on Sour Patch kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppi0khS0s_8)! She made the following discoveries:
- Sour Patch Kids Ingredients
	- Sugar
	- Invert sugar
	- Corn syrup
	- Modified corn starch
	- Tartaric acid 
	- Citric acid
	- Natural and artificial flavoring
- Process notes
	- Pureed citrus is a bad idea, use juice
	- Hydrolyze gelatin in juice
	- Cold dehydration prevents melting and firms well
	- Soaking in grain alcohol
	- She did 2:1 sugar to citric acid
		- Everyone thought it was too sour
		- She mixed dehydrated ground lemon rind in for flavoring
- Final recipe
	1. Combine 1 cup sugar, 3tsp water, and 3.25 cup corn syrup in a small sauce pan
	2. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then bring to 290º F
	3. Bloom 50g gelatin in .5 cup sour cherry, lemon, or orange juice, then stir in 15g pectin
	4. Stir the gelatin/pectin mixture into the sugar syrup along with a pinch of salt, 1.25 tsp citric acid, and corresponding fruit extract until smooth
	5. Pour into a greased pan and chill until set
	6. Punch out shapes and soak in grain alcohol, then chill on a rack
	7. Dehydrate corresponding zest and grind, then combine with 2:1 sugar to citric acid
	8. Coat!

Quick notes on the video: She was pressured for time to finish, so there were some problems! It seems **the flavoring was too sour**, and one editor preferred the texture of the sour cherry to the lemon.

## The Google Facts on Cornstarch
I said I would give Claire's method more weight, but given that Sour Patch Kids use cornstarch, I want to give that a try as well. 

**Cornstarch:** Cornstarch thickens solutions through the process of starch gelatization. 

## Strategy
Based on the different recipes, I think I want to try three approaches: a corn starch setting test (used in real Sour Patch Kids), a pectin based approach, and the BA gelatin-pectin combo approach. While I don't have corn syrup on hand, my hope is sugar will suffice for this first test. Additionally, I'll be testing a single flavor to compare texture and get the pH right.
