# Project 1: Homemade Sour Candy [Part 2]

## Overview
Check out [Part 1](https://github.com/briantanabe/project-log/blob/master/projects/sour%20candy/Sour%20Candy%20Part%201.md) if you missed it, but the overarching goal is to practice documenting a project while doing it! The task at hand is **recreating sour patch kids**, and I think this time around I have some better ideas. Namely, I will be starting with a variation of the cornstarch based recipe I used the last time around.

*Started on Friday, April 23 at 5:00PM*

## Goals
1. Refine the cornstarch based recipe
	2. Atte
2. Take better action shots
