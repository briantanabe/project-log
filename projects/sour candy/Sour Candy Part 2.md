# Project 1: Homemade Sour Candy [Part 2]

## Overview
Check out [Part 1](https://github.com/briantanabe/project-log/blob/master/projects/sour%20candy/Sour%20Candy%20Part%201.md) if you missed it, but the overarching goal is to practice documenting a project while doing it! The task at hand is **recreating sour patch kids**, and I think this time around I have some better ideas. Namely, I will be starting with a variation of the cornstarch based recipe I used the last time around.

*Started on Friday, April 23 at 5:00PM*

## Goals
1. Refine the cornstarch based recipe
2. Take better action shots

## The Research
A quick recap from [Part 1](https://github.com/briantanabe/project-log/blob/master/projects/sour%20candy/Sour%20Candy%20Part%201.md):
>[Fine Cooking](https://www.finecooking.com/article/thickeners) suggested that I could just boil the cornstarch for a bit to release the amylopectin and reduce the starchy flavor. I couldn't find info on the denaturing temperature, so I think I'm going to run with it.
>### Cornstarch Recipe (r00)
>| Instruction | Amount 
>|-|-|
>|Combine *mixture 1* – sugar and water | 1 tbsp + .5 tsp sugar, .25 tsp water
>|Bring mixture 1 to a boil, then to 290º F| X
>|Boil *mixture 2* – lemon juice and corn starch | .025 cup lemon juice, .125 cup cornstarch 
>|Stir mixture 2 into mixture 1 until smooth | X 
>|Pour into greased parchment and chill | X
>|Soak in alcohol then dry|X|
>|Roll in citric acid and sugar | 4:1 citric acid to sugar

I want to more hands on experience this time, so I won't be testing a rigid strategy but rather experimenting and documenting results. 


## Strategy

#### Cornstarch Recipe (r01)
| Recipe | Trial 1 | Trial 2 | Trial 3 |
|-|-|-|-|
|Simmer citrus juice and cornstarch | .5 cup lime juice, .5 cup cornstarch | .5 cup lime juice, .25 cup cornstarch | .5 cup lime juice, 2 Tsp cornstarch 

**Trial 1:** The water barely dissolved all of the cornstarch, and once heated began to congeal, bubble, and burn very quickly

**Trial 2:** The lime juice did not congeal as quickly, but after leaving unstirred for a few minutes, also bubbled, congealed, and was lightly scorched
