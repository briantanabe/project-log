# Project 1: Homemade Sour Candy [Part 2]

## Overview
Check out [Part 1](https://github.com/briantanabe/project-log/blob/master/projects/sour%20candy/Sour%20Candy%20Part%201.md) if you missed it, but the overarching goal is to practice documenting a project while doing it! The task at hand is **recreating sour patch kids**, and I think this time around I have some better ideas. Namely, I will be starting with a variation of the cornstarch based recipe I used the last time around.

*Started on Friday, April 23 at 5:00PM*

## Goals
1. Refine the cornstarch based recipe
2. Take better action shots

## The Research
A quick recap from [Part 1](https://github.com/briantanabe/project-log/blob/master/projects/sour%20candy/Sour%20Candy%20Part%201.md):
>[Fine Cooking](https://www.finecooking.com/article/thickeners) suggested that I could just boil the cornstarch for a bit to release the amylopectin and reduce the starchy flavor. I couldn't find info on the denaturing temperature, so I think I'm going to run with it.
>### Cornstarch Recipe (r00)
>| Instruction | Amount 
>|-|-|
>|Combine *mixture 1* – sugar and water | 1 tbsp + .5 tsp sugar, .25 tsp water
>|Bring mixture 1 to a boil, then to 290º F| X
>|Boil *mixture 2* – lemon juice and corn starch | .025 cup lemon juice, .125 cup cornstarch 
>|Stir mixture 2 into mixture 1 until smooth | X 
>|Pour into greased parchment and chill | X
>|Soak in alcohol then dry|X|
>|Roll in citric acid and sugar | 4:1 citric acid to sugar

I want to more hands on experience this time, so I won't be testing a rigid strategy but rather experimenting and documenting results. 


## Experimentation

**Gelling Agent:** For this stage, I want to refine the preparation of the gelling agent. Specifically, I want a better intuition of what should be happening at this stage, and the specific quantities to use.

| Goal | Trial 1 | Trial 2 | Trial 3 |
|-|-|-|-|
|Simmer citrus juice and cornstarch | .5 cup lime juice, .5 cup cornstarch | .5 cup lime juice, .25 cup cornstarch | .5 cup lime juice, 2 Tsp cornstarch 

**Trial 1:** The water barely dissolved all of the cornstarch, and once heated, the cornstarch formed a heterogenous solid mass that began to bubble and burn.

**Trial 2:** I attempted to use half as much cornstarch, and the lime juice did not congeal as quickly. After leaving on medium for ~3 minutes, the mixture turned into a light yellow gel, but was somewhat heterogenous, and began to bubble and burn. I suspect the starch had begun to breakdown and burn as sugar, meaning more stirring could help at this stage. Nevertheless, if the mixture has to be cooked for ~10 minutes to reduce the starch taste (according to Finer Cooking), there should probably be less cornstarch to start.

**Trial 3:** The mixture quickly formed a homogenous goo and did not burn (thanks to constant stirring). After 10 minutes I poured the goo into a separate container. While Finer Cooking's thickeners page suggested the cornstarch mixture should bubble then simmer, I suspect the article was written about solutions with lower concentrations of cornstarch.

**Sugar Syrup:** Previously I wasn't quite sure what the purpose of the sugar was in all of the recipes, but after consulting [The Joy of Baking](https://www.joyofbaking.com/StagesOfCookedSugar.html), I'm beginning to think the 290º F target in Claire's recipe was to ride the line between soft and hard crack stage. Since I still don't have a candy thermometer, I'll be using this [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/techniques/how_to_test_for_stages_of_sugar_syrup#:~:text=To%20check%20your%20sugar%20syrup,up%20the%20ball%20of%20syrup.) hack of cooling samples of the sugar syrup in ice water as it cools. Once the target soft/hard crack texture is reached, I'll cut the heat and begin slowly incorporating the cornstarch goo.

I'm a bit worried about incorporating the goo, as cornstarch has a tendency to clump, especially when exposed to heat. I'm also not quite sure what the proportion of sugar and cornstarch is supposed to be, and I don't have that much cornstarch mixture. So we'll see how this goes...

**Trial 1:** I added equal parts sugar and water based on earlier recipes, but after realizing that the different stages of sugar syrup are essentially different proportions of sugar and water, I added another half cup of sugar to speed things up. **The final recipe was  .5 cup water, 1 cup sugar**, which I suspect will be too much for the quantity of cornstarch I made.
