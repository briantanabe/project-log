# Project 1: Homemade Sour Candy [Part 2]

## Overview
Check out [Part 1](https://github.com/briantanabe/project-log/blob/master/projects/sour%20candy/Sour%20Candy%20Part%201.md) if you missed it, but the overarching goal is to practice documenting a project while doing it! The task at hand is **recreating sour patch kids**, and I think this time around I have some better ideas. Namely, I will be starting with a variation of the cornstarch based recipe I used the last time around.

*Started on Friday, April 23 at 5:00PM*

## Goals
1. Refine the cornstarch based recipe
2. Take better action shots

## The Research
A quick recap from [Part 1](https://github.com/briantanabe/project-log/blob/master/projects/sour%20candy/Sour%20Candy%20Part%201.md):
>[Fine Cooking](https://www.finecooking.com/article/thickeners) suggested that I could just boil the cornstarch for a bit to release the amylopectin and reduce the starchy flavor. I couldn't find info on the denaturing temperature, so I think I'm going to run with it.
>### Cornstarch Recipe (r00)
>| Instruction | Amount 
>|-|-|
>|Combine *mixture 1* – sugar and water | 1 tbsp + .5 tsp sugar, .25 tsp water
>|Bring mixture 1 to a boil, then to 290º F| X
>|Boil *mixture 2* – lemon juice and corn starch | .025 cup lemon juice, .125 cup cornstarch 
>|Stir mixture 2 into mixture 1 until smooth | X 
>|Pour into greased parchment and chill | X
>|Soak in alcohol then dry|X|
>|Roll in citric acid and sugar | 4:1 citric acid to sugar

I want to more hands on experience this time around taking photos and testing this recipe, so I'm just going to make three variations of this recipe in a larger quantity!

Additionally, given how hectic the kitchen can be, I'm also going to play with the ordering and descriptions of instructions to make the recipes easier to follow on the spot.

## Strategy

#### Cornstarch Recipe (r01a)
| Instruction | Amount 
|-|-|
|Bri *mixture 1* then let cool | .025 cup lemon juice, .125 cup cornstarch 
|Combine *mixture 2* – sugar and water | 1 tbsp + .5 tsp sugar, .25 tsp water
|Bring mixture 1 to a boil, then to 290º F| X
|Stir mixture 2 into mixture 1 until smooth | X
