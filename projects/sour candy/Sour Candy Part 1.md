# Project 1: Homemade Sour Candy [Part 1]


## Overview
**This is an engineering log**, so why am I documenting the process of making sour candy? Simply put, [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  is hard, and documentation is harder. My hope is that starting with easier projects will let me  focus on learning how to *phrase and describe my progress real time.*

**I  love sour patch kids**, and after hitting [Google](http://www.grouprecipes.com/137183/homemade-sour-patch-kids.html), it looked pretty straightforward. I'm sure it will be harder than it looks (*[ahem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppi0khS0s_8)*), so I decided to give it a shot and learn how to fail.

*Started on Tuesday, April 13 at 8:30PM*

## Goals
The goals here are pretty straightforward:
1. Make some candy
2. Learn Markdown
3. **Learn about making sour candy**

I want to spend this first project getting a sense of the actual process and obtaining ~~an intuition~~ data about the ratio of ingredients. Because I couldn't find Tartaric Acid at Whole Foods, the only ingredients I will be investigating this time around are **gelatin**, **citric acid**, **water**, and **sugar**. I also bought **pectin** (*after remembering the time I made Jello Shots for my vegetarian friends*), though I suspect like many vegan substitutes, it may be harder to get right. 


## The Google Facts

**Gelatin:**
Gelatin is commercially produced by first soaked pig skin in acid to release collagen [(Fine Cooking)](https://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-gelatin). The collagen is then heated to 160-180º F, at which point it melts into gelatin. Gelatin is a long, hydroscopic protein that does not readily form bonds with itself. While it does loosen at higher temperatures and form a sticky network that sets when cooled, it will not form bonds and coagulate (unlike an egg). [(Science of Cooking)](https://www.scienceofcooking.com/meat/slow_cooking1.htm#:~:text=160%C2%B0F%2F70%C2%B0,to%20gelatin%20at%20160%2F70.)

**Pectin:**
*Note: Fine cooking has amazing food chemistry primers*
Pectin is a long chain of polysaccharides (a carbohydrate), used to stick the cell walls of plants together. There are two kinds of commercial pectin, high and low methoxyl, or HM and LM. LM pectin sets with the addition of calcium, and HM pectin is far more common (though not always specified).

From what I can tell with my [Wikipedia chemistry degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoxy_group) and more [Fine Cooking](https://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-pectin), methoxyl is a negative molecule that repels itself and is attracted to water. In the presence of acid (positive hydrogen ions), however, the negative charges will be somewhat neutralized. By heating pectin and acid, the pectin chains will loosen and form a loose matrix. Sugar will additionally attract the water molecules, competing with the pectin for water and tightening the chains. Slowly removing the water then firms the network into a sugar-acid-pectin gel, though the required ratios are reportedly very finicky. **This means fast set pectin has higher methylation levels (more methoxyl)** [(Cyber Colloids)](http://www.cybercolloids.net/information/technical-articles/introduction-pectin-properties).

*Todo: Find out pH at which pectin sets*

**Citric Acid:**
Though originally derived from lemons, Citric acid is largely manufactured and sold in powdered form. Citric acid is apparently one of the stronger edible acids, and **the pH of a 1 mM solution of citric acid will be about 3.2.**

**Claire Saffitz:**
If you aren't familiar with Bon Appetit's [Claire Saffitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pAOuR8s03Q), she's gained notoriety for recreating popular foods and talking through her decision making in the process. I trust her process a little more given that I can see results, and she did a [video on Sour Patch kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppi0khS0s_8)! She made the following discoveries:
- Sour Patch Kids Ingredients
	- Sugar
	- Invert sugar
	- Corn syrup
	- Modified corn starch
	- Tartaric acid 
	- Citric acid
	- Natural and artificial flavoring
- Process notes
	- Pureed citrus is a bad idea, use juice
	- Hydrolyze gelatin in juice
	- Cold dehydration prevents melting and firms well
	- Soaking in grain alcohol
	- She did 2:1 sugar to citric acid
		- Everyone thought it was too sour
		- She mixed dehydrated ground lemon rind in for flavoring
- Final recipe
	1. Combine 1 cup sugar, 3tsp water, and 3.25 cup corn syrup in a small sauce pan
	2. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then bring to 290º F
	3. Bloom 50g gelatin in .5 cup sour cherry, lemon, or orange juice, then stir in 15g pectin
	4. Stir the gelatin/pectin mixture into the sugar syrup along with a pinch of salt, 1.25 tsp citric acid, and corresponding fruit extract until smooth
	5. Pour into a greased pan and chill until set
	6. Punch out shapes and soak in grain alcohol, then chill on a rack
	7. Dehydrate corresponding zest and grind, then combine with 2:1 sugar to citric acid
	8. Coat!

Quick notes on the video: She was pressured for time to finish, so there were some problems! It seems **the flavoring was too sour**, and one editor preferred the texture of the sour cherry to the lemon.

## The Google Facts on Cornstarch
I said I would give Claire's method more weight, but given that Sour Patch Kids use cornstarch, I want to give that a try as well. 

**Cornstarch:** Cornstarch thickens solutions through the process of starch gelatinization. When cornstarch is heated in water, the water fills the cornstarch molecule, swelling it. Under heat and in the presence of water, the amylopectin chains in cornstarch will dissolve. Soon, the granule dissolves as the amylopectin is released into the water. ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_starch)[pedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch_gelatinization))

[Fine Cooking](https://www.finecooking.com/article/thickeners) suggested that I could just boil the cornstarch for a bit to release the amylopectin and reduce the starchy flavor. I couldn't find info on the denaturing temperature, so I think I'm going to run with it. It also had a great conversion table. I've converted it, so the following are all equal:
| Starch | Quantity
|-|-|
|Flour|2 tbs|
|Cornstarch| 1 tbs|
|Tapioca|1 tbs|
|Arrowroot|1 tbs + 1.5 tsp|
|Potato starch|1.5 tsp|



## Strategy
Based on the different recipes, I think I want to try three approaches: a corn starch setting test (used in real Sour Patch Kids), a pectin based approach, and the BA gelatin-pectin combo approach. While I don't have corn syrup on hand, my hope is sugar will suffice for now. Additionally, I'll be testing a single flavor to compare texture and get the pH right. 

I also will not be extensively testing different ingredients, as the goal is to try my hand at each of these before diving any deeper.

## Execution
Well.. That did **not** go well. The setup is pictured below.
![The setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/briantanabe/project-log/master/projects/sour%20candy/IMG_0574.jpg)

First I (incorrectly) modified the recipes on the fly to conserve our houses precious cookie ingredients (sugar), which made it difficult to appropriately hydrate and boil the sugar.
![Boiling the sugar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/briantanabe/project-log/master/projects/sour%20candy/IMG_0575.jpg)

I forgot to boil the cornstarch beforehand and mixed the wrong volume, which will likely ruin the flavor and texture
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/briantanabe/project-log/master/projects/sour%20candy/IMG_0576.jpg)

I didn't realize our only thermometer was for meat and didn't go to 390º F, so I eventually caramelized the sugar
![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/briantanabe/project-log/master/projects/sour%20candy/IMG_0578.jpg)

I also somehow managed to buy LM pectin [Pomona's Universal Pectin](https://www.fillmorecontainer.com/media/catalog/product/p/e/pectin_-_pomona_s.jpg)... So I skipped that. 

The gels are in the fridge cooling now, so I'll take some pictures when they come out, but this was my first one that I flattened with a milk frother!

## Results
I completely forgot to take pictures, but the gels were very sticky even after cooling in the fridge. Claire had mentioned needing to use baking spray, and I totally understand why now. After letting them cool I dipped them in Vodka (I don't have Everclear laying around), and let them dry at room temperature.

**Gelatin Gummy:** The gelatin test was much stickier than the cornstarch based one, and was very tart. The texture was still very silky even after letting it dry out, similar to Laffy Taffy. The taste was a little burnt and tart, which is expected with the lemon juice & caramelized sugar.

**Cornstarch Gummy:** The cornstarch test was actually really quite close in terms of the texture, which was very surprising given all of the mistakes I made. It was still sticky, but way less than the gelatin. It (unsurprisingly) tasted like cornstarch given that I forgot to boil it, but otherwise I was really impressed with how it came out. I will be moving forward with cornstarch based recipes in the near future given how close this was to real sour patch kids in terms of texture. I think next steps would involve using Everclear instead of vodka to better desiccate the surface, as well as refining the recipe.

## Reflection
I totally forgot that I tested cornstarch based gummies on a hunch from the ingredients. 

- I should have calculated easier measurements to use beforehand so I could do things a bit more smoothly in the kitchen
- I should just run with one recipe at a time and try different concentrations, it was way too hard to keep track of multiple recipes
- Get smaller pots if I want to test small concentrations
- I probably want to try adding flavoring next time
- I need a more clear cut set of instructions to use beforehand.
	- I wasn't really sure what to do after combining the mixtures (how long to wait, etc.)
- Take better pictures!
